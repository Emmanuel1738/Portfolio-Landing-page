  </li>
</ul>
<p>If I were an animal, I would love to be a dolphin. Why? 
      Dolphins are extraordinarily intelligent animals who also display culture, something which was long-believed to be unique to humans. They have several highly developed forms of communication and they are also known to stay and help injured individuals, even helping them to the surface to breath. Their compassion also extends across the species-barrier. There are many accounts of dolphins helping humans and even whales.

The page has details on sex education and the information present has been divided into groups, in such a way that age and gender are factors. The languages used are HTML and CSS.
